  # The following line ensures that the Material Icons font is
  # included with your application, so that you can use the icons in
  # the material Icons class.

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    # - assets/loading/
    # - assets/logo/
    - assets/icon/
    - assets/icon/account/
    - assets/icon/appbar/
    - assets/icon/bottom-nav/
    - assets/icon/menu/
    - assets/icon/menu-promo/
    - assets/icon/user/
    - assets/icon/sosmed/
    - assets/icon/bank/
    - assets/icon/security/
    - assets/lottie/
    - assets/lottie/icon/
    # - assets/images/official/
    # - assets/images/promo/
    - assets/images/background/
    - assets/images/ufomen/
    - assets/images/bank/
    - assets/images/splash/

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  # fonts:
  #   - family: Schyler
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Regular.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Italic.ttf
  #         style: italic
  #   - family: Trajan Pro
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro_Bold.ttf
  #         weight: 700
